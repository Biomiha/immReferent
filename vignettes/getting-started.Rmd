## Introduction

The `immReferent` package provides a centralized and easy-to-use interface for downloading, managing, and loading immune repertoire and HLA reference sequences from the IMGT, IPD-IMGT/HLA and OGRDB databases. Its primary goal is to ensure that analyses are based on consistent, up-to-date, and correctly formatted reference data.

This vignette will walk you through the basic functionality of the package.

```{r setup}
library(immReferent)
```

## Downloading Reference Sequences

The main function for all data retrieval is `getIMGT()`. It handles both downloading new data from the source and loading previously downloaded data from a local cache.

### Downloading HLA Sequences (IPD-IMGT/HLA)

The IPD-IMGT/HLA database provides reference sequences for the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system. You can download the complete set of nucleotide or protein sequences using `gene = "HLA"`.

```{r get_hla, eval = imgt_ok}
# Download all available HLA protein sequences
# This will download the file to the cache on the first run
hla_prot <- getIMGT(gene = "HLA", 
                    type = "PROT")

# Inspect the result
print(hla_prot)
cat("Number of sequences:", length(hla_prot), "\n")
cat("First sequence name:", names(hla_prot)[1], "\n")
```

### Downloading TCR/BCR Sequences (IMGT)

For T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) genes, you can specify the species and the gene or gene family you are interested in.

```{r get_ighv, eval = imgt_ok}
# Download human IGHV nucleotide sequences
ighv_nuc <- getIMGT(species = "human", 
                    gene = "IGHV", 
                    type = "NUC")

# Inspect the result
print(ighv_nuc)
```

You can also download entire families of genes at once by specifying a group name like `"IGH"`, `"IGK"`, `"TRB"`, etc.

```{r get_trb, eval = imgt_ok}
# Download all mouse TRB genes (V, D, J, and C)
trb_mouse <- getIMGT(species = "mouse",
                     gene = "TRB", 
                     type = "NUC")

# This object will contain TRBV, TRBD, TRBJ, and TRBC sequences
print(trb_mouse)
```

### Downloading Germline Sets from OGRDB (AIRR)

OGRDB provides AIRR-compliant **germline sets** for immunoglobulin loci (and growing coverage more broadly). You can retrieve:

- **FASTA** (gapped or ungapped) nucleotide sequences, or
- **AIRR JSON**, which we parse into `DNAStringSet` (and optionally translate to `AAStringSet`).

```{r ogrdb_igh_fasta, eval=ogrdb_ok}
# Human IGH nucleotide sequences (gapped FASTA)
igh_ogrdb <- getOGRDB(
  species = "human",
  locus   = "IGH",
  type    = "NUC",
  format  = "FASTA_GAPPED"
)
igh_ogrdb
```

Pulling the AIRR-formatted sequences:

```{r ogrdb_igk_airr, eval=ogrdb_ok}
# Human IGK sequences via AIRR JSON (parsed to DNAStringSet)
igk_airr <- getOGRDB(
  species = "human",
  locus   = "IGK",
  type    = "NUC",
  format  = "AIRR"
)
igk_airr
```

## Working with the Cache

`immReferent` automatically caches all downloaded data to avoid repeated downloads and to enable offline work.

### Listing Cached Files

You can see all the files currently in your cache using the `listIMGT()` or `listOGRDB()` function.

```{r list_imgt, eval=imgt_ok}
# List the full paths of all cached files
listIMGT()
listOGRDB()
```

### Loading from Cache

When you call `getIMGT()`, it will always load data from the cache if it's available. If you want to *only* load from the cache and prevent any possibility of a download, you can use `loadIMGT()`. This function is useful in offline environments or for ensuring strict reproducibility.

```{r load_imgt, eval=imgt_ok}
# This will load from the cache if available, or download otherwise
ighv_nuc <- getIMGT(species = "human", 
                    gene = "IGHV", 
                    type = "NUC")

# This will load from the cache, or fail if not found and offline
ighv_nuc_from_cache <- loadIMGT(species = "human", 
                                gene = "IGHV", 
                                type = "NUC")
```

Similar to the above, we can pull and load from OGRDB using `getOGRDB()` and `loadOGRDB()`.

```{r eval=ogrdb_ok}
# This will load from the cache if available, or download otherwise
igh_nuc <- getOGRDB(species = "human", 
                    locus = "IGH", 
                    type = "NUC", 
                    format = "FASTA_GAPPED")

# This will load from the cache, or fail if not found and offline
igh_from_cache <- loadOGRDB(species = "human", 
                            locus = "IGH", 
                            type = "NUC", 
                            format = "FASTA_GAPPED")
```

### Refreshing the Cache

If you suspect the online data has been updated and you want to re-download it, you can use `refreshIMGT()` or `refreshOGRDB()`. This is just a convenient shortcut for `getIMGT(..., refresh = TRUE)`.

```{r refresh_imgt, eval=imgt_ok & ogrdb_ok}
# Force a re-download of the human IGHV sequences
ighv_nuc_fresh <- refreshIMGT(species = "human", 
                              gene = "IGHV", 
                              type = "NUC")

# Force a re-download of human IGK (gapped FASTA)
igk_fresh <- refreshOGRDB(species = "human", 
                          locus = "IGK", 
                          type = "NUC", 
                          format = "FASTA_GAPPED")
```
