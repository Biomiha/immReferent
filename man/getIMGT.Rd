\usage{
getIMGT(
  species = "human",
  gene,
  type = c("NUC", "PROT"),
  refresh = FALSE,
  suppressMessages = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{The species for which to download data. Required for TCR/BCR queries.
Currently supported: "human", "mouse", "rat", "rabbit", "rhesus_monkey". Defaults to "human" for HLA.}

\item{gene}{The gene or locus to download. For TCR/BCR, this can be a specific
chain (e.g., "IGHV", "TRBJ") or a group (e.g., "IGH", "TCR"). For HLA, use "HLA".}

\item{type}{The type of sequence to retrieve. Either "NUC" for nucleotide or
"PROT" for protein sequences. This primarily distinguishes between VDJ nucleotide
and V-region amino acid sequences for TCR/BCR genes.}

\item{refresh}{Logical. If `TRUE`, forces a re-download of the data even if it
exists in the cache.}

\item{suppressMessages}{Logical. If `TRUE`, suppresses the license and other
informational messages.}
}
\value{
A `DNAStringSet` or `AAStringSet` object containing the requested sequences.
}
\description{
This is the main function to download and load reference sequences from IMGT
and the IPD-IMGT/HLA database. It handles caching of downloaded files.

\examples{
if(is_imgt_available()) {
  # Download human IGHV nucleotide sequences
  ighv_nuc <- getIMGT(species = "human", 
                      gene = "IGHV", 
                      type = "NUC")

  # Download all HLA protein sequences
  hla_prot <- getIMGT(gene = "HLA", 
                      type = "PROT")

  # Download all mouse TRB genes
  trb_mouse <- getIMGT(species = "mouse", 
                      gene = "TRB", 
                      type = "NUC")
}

# Example with a cached sequence file
test_seqs_file <- system.file("extdata", "test_seqs.fasta", package = "immReferent")
# In a real scenario, you would copy this to your cache.
# For this example, we'll read it directly.
seqs <- Biostrings::readDNAStringSet(test_seqs_file)
print(seqs)
